        <h2>Mission:</h2>
        <p>Having realized that Ohio is one of the states that has not implemented the return back recycling program for incentives, 
            this website has the mission of encouraging individuals,households,retail stores to recycle plastic, glass and metal products but 
            getting side cash from recycling companies directly into their accounts anytime they successfully return their used items.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Vision:</h2>
        <p>This website can be taken to the next level by having a simple sensor that reads a live feed from 
            your recycling bin and keeps track of how much you can recieve
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Plastic effects on the environment have been a major problem in our society that has been looked over for some time now.
            We can all play a certain part in reducing this problem.
        </p>
        
        <p>Ohio has made it possible to make money with plastic bottles/Aluminium can even if they are not manufactured in Ohio!<br/>
            This site is here to show you how much money you can possibly make from your waste 
            and help you track how much you have made when you have returned them
